# Mern-Book-Search

## Description
Mern Book Search Engine is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API. Users can sign up, log in, and save their favorite books to a personal collection. This project demonstrates the use of GraphQL with Apollo Server for managing API requests and MongoDB Atlas for database management.
